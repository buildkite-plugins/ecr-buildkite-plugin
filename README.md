# ECR Buildkite Plugin

__This is designed to run with Buildkite Agent v3.x beta. Plugins are not yet supported in Buildkite Agent v2.x.__

Interact with [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) in your build steps.

Supports authenticating docker and removing tags/images.

## Login Example

This will login docker to ECR prior to running your script.

```yml
steps:
  - command: ./run_build.sh
    plugins:
      ecr#v1.1.2:
        login: true
```

## Delete Example

This will delete a set of tags used by the docker-compose plugin:

```yml
steps:
  - plugins:
      lox/ecr#v1.0.0:
        delete: 
          repository: myimagerepo
          tags: "${BUILDKITE_PIPELINE_SLUG}-app-build-${BUILDKITE_BUILD_NUMBER}""
```
